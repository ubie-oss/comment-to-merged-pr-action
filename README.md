## Use cases

### Comment to the merged pull request if all jobs are passed
The examples show how to comment to the merged pull request if all jobs are passed.
We assume that the job1 and job2 are the jobs that are executed when the pull request is merged into the default branch.
Those can be something like to deploy a product.

```yaml
name: "Create a comment to the merged pull request"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  comment:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: "Dummy failed step"
        id: dummy-failed-step
        run: |
          echo "The dummy task was failed."
          exit 1
      # The step is triggered only when dummy-failed-step is failed.
      - uses: ubie-oss/comment-to-merged-pr-action@v0.1.0
        if: ${{ failure() }}
        id: comment-to-merged-pr
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          message: |-
            The dummy task was failed.
            Please take a look at ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }} .
```
